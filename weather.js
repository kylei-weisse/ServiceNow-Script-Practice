/*
MVP: hourly/realtime weather update in 30030, pushed into a 
servicenow database. 
Second step is a few more zip codes with some favorite campsites.
Third step is dynamically create table based on a "create campsite" button.

Once all those done, if I can get to it,
make a react native app that pushes the currently selected 
zip code to the phone every 4 hours during storm fronts, 
and every 10 hours otherwise. 

ServiceNow specific things:
    put the zipcode request as a service request
